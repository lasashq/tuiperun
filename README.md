# Features
## four workmodes:
+ **Beginning:** you have to fill in the line with the same word. 

+ **Base:** the same as previous, but the words in line are different. Also there are some punctuation marks after words. 

+ **Training:** you have to type one word three times. You have no margin for mistake. You start over if you make a mistake.

+ **Practice:** typing a text. 

## Mistake highlighting 

Mistake highlights if you make one.

## On-screen keyboard

You can see the keyboard on your screen. You mustn't watch your physical keyboard to improve your blind typing. The position of letter you need highlights on the screen.

## Zen-mode

There is nothing on your screen, just an input field and a text you have to type. *For advanced blindtypers*.

## Hotkey control

Switching between modes and languages is realised by keybindings.
